A simple tool to manage and switch between multiple Claude Code accounts on macOS, Linux, and WSL.

## Demo

## Features

- **Multi-account management** — Add, remove, and list Claude Code accounts
- **Quick switching** — Rotate accounts or switch to a specific one by number, email, or profile name
- **Named profiles** — Give accounts friendly names like `work` or `personal`
- **Directory-based auto-switching** — Map directories to accounts and auto-switch when you `cd`
- **Dry-run mode** — Preview what a switch would do without making changes
- **Rollback** — Automatic rollback if a switch fails mid-way
- **Rate limit auto-switch** — Automatically switch accounts when usage limits are hit, via Claude Code hooks
- **Diagnostics** — Health checks, status, and per-account usage statistics
- **Cross-platform** — Works on macOS, Linux, and WSL
- **Secure storage** — Uses system keychain (macOS) or protected files (Linux/WSL)
- **Settings preservation** — Only switches authentication; themes, settings, and preferences stay unchanged

## Installation

![install](assets/install.gif)

### curl (quickest)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher/main/ccswitch.sh -o /usr/local/bin/ccs
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ccs
```

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install fairy-pitta/tap/ccswitch
```

### npm / npx

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher

# Or run without installing
npx @fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher --help
```

### Make

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher.git
cd cc-account-switcher
sudo make install
```

### Manual

Download `ccswitch.sh` from the [latest release](https://github.com/fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher/releases) and place it in your `$PATH` as `ccs`.

## Quick Start

![quickstart](assets/quickstart.gif)

1. Log into Claude Code with your first account
2. `ccs add` — save current credentials
3. Log out, log into your second account
4. `ccs add` — save the second set of credentials
5. `ccs sw` — rotate between accounts
6. Restart Claude Code after each switch

> **What gets switched:** Only authentication credentials. Your themes, settings, preferences, and chat history remain unchanged.

## Usage

### Account Management

```bash
ccs add                          # Add current account
ccs ls                           # List all managed accounts
ccs rm 2                         # Remove account by number
ccs rm user@example.com          # Remove account by email
```

### Switching

```bash
ccs sw                           # Rotate to next account
ccs to 2                         # Switch to account #2
ccs to user@example.com          # Switch by email
ccs to work                      # Switch by profile name
ccs -n sw                        # Dry-run: preview what would happen
ccs sw -r                        # Switch and restart Claude Code
ccs sw --no-restart              # Switch without restart prompt
```

### Profiles

```bash
ccs profile 1 work               # Name account 1 "work"
ccs profile 2 personal           # Name account 2 "personal"
ccs to work                      # Then switch by profile name
```

### Directory-based Auto-switching

```bash
ccs dir ~/work 1                 # Map ~/work to account 1
ccs dir ~/personal 2             # Map ~/personal to account 2
ccs auto                         # Switch based on current directory
```

### Rate Limit Auto-switch

Automatically switch to the next account when your 5-hour usage exceeds a threshold. Uses Claude Code's [PreToolUse hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) system — no polling, no background processes.

```bash
# Set up (one-time) — installs a PreToolUse hook into Claude Code
ccs rate-setup                   # Enable with default 80% threshold
ccs rate-setup --threshold 70    # Custom threshold

# Manual check
ccs rate-check                   # Check current usage vs threshold
ccs rate-check --auto-switch     # Check and switch if exceeded
ccs rate-check --max-age 30      # Treat the cache as stale after 30s

# Disable
ccs rate-setup --disable         # Remove hook and disable
```

**How it works:**

1. The usage cache lives at `/tmp/claude-usage-cache.json` with a `cached_at` timestamp.
2. Before each tool call the PreToolUse hook checks the cache. If it's fresh (younger than the TTL) and under threshold, it returns immediately (~20ms, no API call).
3. If the cache is missing, stale, or for a different account, the hook refreshes it from the [Anthropic OAuth Usage API](https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage) on demand — so it works in headless `claude -p` runs with no statusline.
4. If usage exceeds the threshold, it switches to the next account and tells Claude Code to deny the tool call with a "please restart" message.
5. Switches take an exclusive lock, so concurrent agents (e.g. an orchestrator's heartbeats) can't race or thrash accounts.
6. All errors fail open — a broken hook never blocks your work.

**Cache TTL:** the cache is considered fresh for `DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL` (60s) by default. Override per-install with `.rateLimit.cacheTtl` in `~/.claude-switch-backup/sequence.json`, or per-invocation with `--max-age SECONDS`. A short TTL means fresher data at the cost of more API calls; a longer TTL means fewer calls.

> **Note (multi-account at the same time):** `ccswitch` rewrites a single machine-global credential store, so all Claude Code processes on the machine share one account at a time. Auto-switch is built for the *sequential* case — "when this account is exhausted, rotate to the next." Running different accounts in parallel requires per-process isolation via Claude Code's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

### Diagnostics

```bash
ccs check                        # Verify backup integrity (JSON, permissions, keychain)
ccs status                       # Current account, token expiry, last switch
ccs stats                        # Per-account usage statistics
```

### Other

```bash
ccs version                      # Show version
ccs help                         # Show help
```

### Running as root

By default the script refuses to run as `root`, because credentials and backups are
stored per-user (under `$HOME` and, on macOS, the user's Keychain). Running as root
targets a different home/Keychain and can leave root-owned files behind that break
your normal user.

If you understand the risks (e.g. sandbox or container testing), opt out with the
`--allow-root` flag or the `CCSWITCH_ALLOW_ROOT=1` environment variable:

```bash
ccs --allow-root ls              # Flag (can go before or after the command)
CCSWITCH_ALLOW_ROOT=1 ccs ls     # Environment variable
```

Containers are detected automatically and allowed without the flag.

### Shell Integration

Add to your shell profile to enable completions and the `ccs` alias:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):

```bash
source "$(command -v ccs)" --shell-init bash 2>/dev/null
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):

```bash
source "$(command -v ccs)" --shell-init zsh 2>/dev/null
```

**Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

```fish
source "$(command -v ccs)" --shell-init fish 2>/dev/null
```

## Requirements

- Bash 3.2+
- `jq` (JSON processor)

### Installing Dependencies

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install jq
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

## How It Works

The switcher stores account authentication data separately:

- **macOS**: Credentials in Keychain, OAuth info in `~/.claude-switch-backup/`
- **Linux/WSL**: Both credentials and OAuth info in `~/.claude-switch-backup/` with restricted permissions

When switching accounts, it:

1. Backs up the current account's authentication data
2. Restores the target account's authentication data
3. Updates Claude Code's authentication files
4. Automatically rolls back if any step fails

## Troubleshooting

Run `ccs check` first — it verifies JSON validity, file permissions, and keychain entries.

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Switch fails | Run `ccs check` to diagnose. Ensure Claude Code is closed. |
| Can't add account | Ensure you're logged into Claude Code. Verify `jq` is installed. |
| Claude Code doesn't recognize new account | Restart Claude Code after switching, or use `ccs sw -r`. |
| Not sure which account is active | Run `ccs ls` — the active account is marked. |

## Cleanup / Uninstall

1. Note your current active account: `ccs ls`
2. Remove the backup directory: `rm -rf ~/.claude-switch-backup`
3. Uninstall:
   - **make**: `sudo make uninstall`
   - **npm**: `npm uninstall -g @fairy-pitta/cc-account-switcher`
   - **manual**: `rm /usr/local/bin/ccs`

Your current Claude Code login will remain active.

## Security

- macOS credentials stored in system Keychain
